## 🎯 Mission

To democratize financial education and empower every Australian with the knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions.

## 📊 The Problem We're Solving

- 67% of Australians lack basic financial literacy
- Young people struggle with debt management
- Elderly population vulnerable to financial scams
- Complex financial products create confusion
- Limited access to quality financial education

## 🎨 Logo

The logo placeholder is currently a simple "C" in a blue rounded square. You can replace this with your actual logo by:

1. Adding your logo file to the `public/` directory
2. Updating the logo references in `src/components/Navbar.jsx` and `src/components/Footer.jsx`
