# Frontend Design Standards

## Core Philosophy
- **Rich Aesthetics**: Every page should WOW the user at first glance.
- **Visual Excellence**: Curated palettes, HSL tailoring, sleek dark modes.
- **Modern Typography**: Use Google Fonts like Inter, Roboto, or Outfit.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Responsive hover effects, micro-animations, and glassmorphism.

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Foundation First**: Update `index.css` with core design tokens and variables before building.
2. **Component Focus**: Build focused, reusable components adhering to the design system.
3. **SEO Integration**: descriptive title tags, meta descriptions, and semantic HTML.
4. **Performance**: Optimize for fast load times and smooth transitions.
