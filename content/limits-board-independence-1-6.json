      "content": "**CEO influence over board appointments**\n\n- In many companies, **CEOs play a dominant role** in selecting new directors.\n- Historically, boards relied heavily on **CEO recommendations** rather than independent search processes.\n- Although **outside involvement has increased**, CEOs still exert significant influence over who joins the board.\n- Directors selected by CEOs may be less willing to challenge them, reducing board independence."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Limited financial incentives for directors**\n\n- Directors often hold **relatively small equity stakes** in the companies they oversee.\n- In many cases, their **compensation as directors exceeds** the value of their personal shareholdings.\n- Any shares they do hold are frequently **granted by the firm** rather than purchased independently.\n- This weakens alignment with shareholders and reduces incentives to closely monitor management."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Interlocking directorships among CEOs**\n\n- Many board members are themselves **CEOs of other companies**.\n- In some cases, CEOs sit on **each other's boards**, creating networks of mutual oversight.\n- These relationships can **weaken independence** and reduce the likelihood of strong managerial challenges.\n- Directors may be reluctant to challenge peers who could reciprocate by challenging them."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**CEO control of board processes**\n\n- In many boards, the **CEO also serves as chair**.\n- This allows the CEO to:\n  - **Set meeting agendas**\n  - **Lead discussions**\n  - **Control the flow of information** provided to directors\n- This limits the board's ability to **independently assess management performance** and creates a conflict of interest."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Consensus over confrontation**\n\n- Board culture often prioritises **cooperation and consensus**.\n- This emphasis on being a **\"team player\"** can discourage directors from openly questioning or challenging management decisions.\n- Even when concerns exist, directors may avoid confrontation to maintain relationships.\n- This focus on harmony can reduce board effectiveness in monitoring management."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**The CEO as an authority figure**\n\n- Psychological research shows that people tend to display **strong loyalty to authority figures**.\n- In board settings, the **CEO often fills this role**.\n- This can lead directors to **suppress ethical concerns** or independent judgment in favour of loyalty and alignment.\n- The authority dynamic can override directors' duty to independently monitor and challenge management."
