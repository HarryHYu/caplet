      "content": "**Conflicts between shareholders and lenders**\n\n- **Bondholders** lend money to businesses and expect to be repaid with interest.\n- Their interests can be **harmed** if managers take actions that favour shareholders at the expense of lenders.\n- While **loan covenants** and **lender protections** exist, they only provide **partial protection**.\n- Managers may still make decisions that increase risk for bondholders while benefiting shareholders."
