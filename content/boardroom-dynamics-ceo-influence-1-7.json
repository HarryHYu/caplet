      "content": "**Managerial power without shareholder discipline**\n\n- When managers do **not fear discipline** from shareholders, they are more likely to prioritise their **own interests** over those of stockholders.\n- Weak shareholder oversight creates opportunities for managers to make decisions that benefit themselves rather than shareholders.\n- This lack of accountability can lead to actions that reduce firm value."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Greenmail as a defensive strategy**\n\n- **Greenmail** occurs when management buys out a **hostile acquirer's stake at a premium** in exchange for a **standstill agreement**.\n- This prevents further takeover attempts and protects management's position.\n- While it stops the immediate threat, it uses company resources to protect management rather than benefit shareholders."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Golden parachutes and managerial protection**\n\n- **Golden parachutes** are clauses in executive contracts that guarantee **large payments** if managers lose their jobs following a takeover.\n- These payments **reduce personal risk** for management during takeover situations.\n- While they may help attract executives, they can also make managers less resistant to takeovers that might benefit shareholders."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Poison pills as takeover deterrents**\n\n- **Poison pills** are securities or rights that are **triggered by hostile takeover attempts**.\n- They make the acquisition **significantly more costly or unattractive** to outsiders.\n- While they protect management, they can prevent value-enhancing takeovers that would benefit shareholders."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Shark repellents and shareholder approval**\n\n- **Shark repellents** are anti-takeover provisions that **require shareholder approval**.\n- While still defensive, they differ from other mechanisms by **involving stockholders directly**.\n- This gives shareholders a voice, but they may still approve provisions that ultimately reduce their own power."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Overpaying in takeovers**\n\n- Many acquisitions are driven by **managerial motives** rather than shareholder value.\n- **Overpaying in takeovers** is one of the fastest ways to **destroy stockholder wealth**.\n- Managers may pursue acquisitions for reasons such as:\n  - Building larger empires\n  - Increasing their own compensation\n  - Reducing personal risk through diversification\n- These motives often conflict with maximising shareholder value."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Market reaction to takeover announcements**\n\n- **Stock prices of acquiring firms frequently fall** when takeovers are announced.\n- This indicates that **shareholders often do not share management's enthusiasm** for acquisitions.\n- The market's negative reaction suggests that many takeovers are expected to destroy rather than create value."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Why many mergers fail**\n\n- Evidence suggests that many mergers **do not succeed**:\n  - **Profitability of merged firms** often does not improve relative to peers\n  - A **significant number of mergers are later reversed**, signalling failure\n- Common reasons for failure include:\n  - Overpayment\n  - Cultural conflicts\n  - Integration challenges\n  - Managerial overconfidence"
