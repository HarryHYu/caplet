      "content": "**Formal mechanisms for manager accountability**\n\n- In theory, shareholders are assumed to have **strong control** over management.\n- Two main mechanisms are meant to hold managers accountable:\n  - **Annual general meetings** – shareholders can voice concerns and use voting rights to influence managerial behaviour\n  - **Board of directors** – expected to represent shareholder interests and monitor management decisions\n- These mechanisms are designed to align management actions with shareholder interests."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Limits of shareholder control in practice**\n\n- In practice, however, these mechanisms are often **less effective** than theory suggests.\n- Management is **not always disciplined** as strongly as intended.\n- The gap between theory and practice creates opportunities for managers to prioritise their own interests over shareholders."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Why annual meetings weaken shareholder influence**\n\n- The ability of shareholders to influence management through annual meetings is weakened by several factors:\n  - **Many small shareholders** choose not to attend meetings because the time and cost involved outweigh the value of their investment\n  - **Management has an advantage** in proxy voting – unsubmitted proxy votes typically default in favour of current management\n- This gives management significant control over meeting outcomes."
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "content": "**Why large shareholders rarely challenge management**\n\n- For **large shareholders**, the easiest response to poor management is often to **sell their shares** rather than challenge decisions directly.\n- This is particularly true for **passive investors** such as index funds.\n- In addition, annual meetings are usually **highly structured and tightly controlled**, which limits opportunities for outsiders or dissenting voices to raise issues that management may prefer to avoid."
